# QuickPost â€“ Scalable Social Feed App

**QuickPost** is a backend-focused learning project that simulates the core components of a scalable social media feed system. It is designed to practice and demonstrate real-world system design concepts like:

- Load balancing
- Caching
- Database sharding & replication
- CDN integration
- Message queues
- Rate limiting
- Horizontal scaling
- Service decomposition (monolith to microservices)
- Asynchronous processing
- Data consistency and availability

This project is intentionally kept simple on the front-end but powerful in architecture to help developers understand how to scale applications from **zero to millions of users**.
